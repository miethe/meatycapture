  Generate and optimize PRDs, Implementation Plans, and Progress Tracking
  documents optimized as AI artifacts for development agents. Use when
  creating new feature plans, breaking down long planning docs (>800 lines),
  or setting up progress tracking. Supports: 1) Create PRD from feature
  request, 2) Create Implementation Plan from PRD with phase breakdown and
  subagent assignments, 3) Optimize existing plans by breaking into
  phase-specific files, 4) Create progress tracking with task assignments.
  Example: "Create a PRD for user authentication feature" or "Break down the
  sidebar-polish implementation plan into phase files" or "Create progress
  tracking for data-layer-fixes PRD".

# Planning Skill

Generate and optimize Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) and Implementation Plans as AI artifacts - file-based context caches optimized for AI agent consumption.

## Purpose

- Generate comprehensive PRDs from feature requests
- Create phased Implementation Plans with subagent task assignments
- Optimize existing planning docs by breaking into token-efficient files
- Set up progress tracking (delegates to artifact-tracking skill)

## Key Benefits

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Token Efficiency | Max ~800 lines per file for optimal AI context |
| Progressive Disclosure | Summary → Detail pattern with linked files |
| Subagent Integration | Automatic task assignment to specialists |
| MP Architecture | Plans follow layered architecture |

---

## Quick Start

### Create PRD
```bash
User: "Create a PRD for advanced filtering on the prompts page"
# Output: docs/project_plans/PRDs/[category]/advanced-filtering-v1.md
```

### Create Implementation Plan
```bash
User: "Create implementation plan for docs/project_plans/PRDs/features/advanced-filtering-v1.md"
# Output: Main plan + phase files (if >800 lines)
```

### Optimize Existing Plan
```bash
User: "Optimize docs/project_plans/implementation_plans/harden-polish/sidebar-polish-v1.md"
# Breaks 1200-line plan into summary + 3 phase files
```

### Create Progress Tracking
```bash
User: "Create progress tracking for data-layer-fixes PRD"
# Delegates to artifact-tracking skill
```

## Core Workflows

| # | Workflow | Input | Output | Details |
|---|----------|-------|--------|---------|
| 1 | Create PRD | Feature request | PRD file | [./workflows/create-prd.md](./workflows/create-prd.md) |
| 2 | Create Implementation Plan | PRD path | Plan + phase files | [./workflows/create-implementation-plan.md](./workflows/create-implementation-plan.md) |
| 3 | Optimize Existing Plan | Plan path (>800 lines) | Optimized structure | [./workflows/optimize-existing-plans.md](./workflows/optimize-existing-plans.md) |
| 4 | Create Progress Tracking | PRD or Plan | Progress artifacts | [./workflows/create-progress-tracking.md](./workflows/create-progress-tracking.md) |

---

## File Organization

### PRDs
```
docs/project_plans/PRDs/[category]/[feature-name]-v1.md
Categories: harden-polish, features, enhancements, refactors
```

### Implementation Plans
```
docs/project_plans/implementation_plans/[category]/[feature-name]-v1.md
Phase files (if >800 lines): [feature-name]-v1/phase-[N]-[name].md
```

See [./references/file-structure.md](./references/file-structure.md) for complete structure.

## Templates

| Template | Purpose | Location |
|----------|---------|----------|
| PRD | Standard PRD structure | [./templates/prd-template.md](./templates/prd-template.md) |
| Implementation Plan | Phased plan with tasks | [./templates/implementation-plan-template.md](./templates/implementation-plan-template.md) |
| Phase Breakdown | Individual phase file | [./templates/phase-breakdown-template.md](./templates/phase-breakdown-template.md) |

## Subagent Integration

Plans integrate with 50+ project subagents. Key assignments:

| Domain | Primary Subagents |
|--------|-------------------|
| Database | data-layer-expert |
| Repository | python-backend-engineer, data-layer-expert |
| Service | backend-architect, python-backend-engineer |
| API | python-backend-engineer, backend-architect |
| Frontend | ui-engineer-enhanced, frontend-developer |
| Testing | testing specialist (varies by type) |
| Documentation | documentation-writer, documentation-complex |

See [./references/subagent-assignments.md](./references/subagent-assignments.md) for complete mapping.

---

## Token Efficiency

### Before Optimization
```
Load 1200-line plan for any query = 1200 lines context
```

### After Optimization
```
Overview query: Load 200-line summary only (83% reduction)
Phase query: Load 200 + 400-line phase = 600 lines (50% reduction)
```

See [./references/optimization-patterns.md](./references/optimization-patterns.md) for patterns.

## Request-Log Integration

When feature requests come from request-log items (REQ-YYYYMMDD-*), update their status:

```bash
# Mark item as planned when implementation plan is created
meatycapture log item update DOC ITEM --status planned

# Add note linking to the plan
meatycapture log note add DOC ITEM -c "PRD: docs/project_plans/PRDs/... Implementation plan: docs/project_plans/implementation_plans/..."
```

Use `/mc update` and `/mc note` for token-efficient operations.
